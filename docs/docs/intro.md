# Course Intro

Let's play with **ink** together.

## Smart Contract Intro

There are a few options to build decentralized application,

- build your own chain
- build dapps on a public blockchain like Ethereum
- build dapps with non-blockchain tech, like Hypercore, libp2p, etc.

Why you want to build with smart contracts?

- maintain a blockchain require heavy investment of capital and human resources
- blockchain related tech is the **go-to** option to build transactional business
- non-blockchain tech is still early to use in production.
