# Course Intro

The documentation at [use.ink](https://use.ink/) already provides comprehensive resources to learn ink!, the programming language to build smart contracts in Substrate ecosystem. The course here is not meant to be a replacement of ink documentation, it instead tries to guide developers to start the journey in a more engaged and iteractive way. The course includes, 

- overview of smart contract
- build an easy dapp from scratch
- videos and code snippets.

Without further ado, let's play **ink!** together.

## Smart Contract Intro

There are a few options to build a decentralized application,

- build your own blockchain
- build dapps on a public blockchain like Ethereum
- build dapps with non-blockchain tech, like Hypercore, libp2p, etc.

Why you want to build with smart contracts?

- maintain a blockchain require heavy investment of capital and human resources
- blockchain related tech is the **go-to** option to build transactional business
- non-blockchain tech is still early to use in production.


## Why use ink

If you like Rust, you should feel home to use ink. It shares the same tools of Rust ecoystem.
